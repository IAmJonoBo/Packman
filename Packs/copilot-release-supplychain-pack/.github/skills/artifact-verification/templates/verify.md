# Verifying a Release (Template)

## 1) Get artifacts

- Download artifacts and SBOM from release assets or registry.

## 2) Verify integrity

- Verify checksum/digest (sha256 or registry digest).

## 3) Verify provenance

- Verify attestation using your platform's guidance (e.g., GitHub artifact attestations).

## 4) Verify SBOM presence

- Confirm SBOM format and that version/digest matches the artifact.
