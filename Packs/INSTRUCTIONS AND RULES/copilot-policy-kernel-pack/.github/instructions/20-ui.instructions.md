- Always implement empty/loading/error states.
- Accessibility is non-negotiable: keyboard nav, focus order, labels, contrasts.
- Use consistent spacing and typography scales; avoid “magic numbers” without tokens.
- Prefer component composition; avoid duplication.

When uncertain about UI specs:
- Ask for target platform, design system, brand constraints, and example references.
