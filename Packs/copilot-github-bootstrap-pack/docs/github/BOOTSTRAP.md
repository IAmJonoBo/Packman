# GitHub Bootstrap Notes

This repo contains a baseline set of GitHub hygiene files:

- Issue forms (bug/feature/docs)
- PR template
- CODEOWNERS (replace placeholders)
- SECURITY policy
- CONTRIBUTING / SUPPORT / CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- Dependabot config (optional)

After dropping this pack in:

1. Replace placeholders in CODEOWNERS and SECURITY.md.
2. Adjust issue template links (Discussions URL).
3. Tune dependabot ecosystems/schedules to your repo.
