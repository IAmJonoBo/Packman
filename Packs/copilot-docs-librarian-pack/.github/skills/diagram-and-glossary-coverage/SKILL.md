# Diagram + Glossary Coverage

## Diagrams
- Use Mermaid for:
  - flowcharts (processes)
  - sequence diagrams (interfaces)
  - state diagrams (UI/system states)
  - architecture graphs (boundaries/modules)
- Place diagrams near the text they explain.
- Keep diagrams accurate to code; update when behaviour changes.

## Glossary
- Maintain a single glossary (default: `docs/glossary.md`).
- Define acronyms on first use and link to glossary.
- Prefer short, precise definitions.

## Templates
- [Mermaid snippets](./templates/mermaid-snippets.md)
- [Glossary template](./templates/glossary.md)
