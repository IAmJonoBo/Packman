# Trunk Discipline

## Core rules
- Main/trunk is always releasable.
- Integrate frequently; keep branches short-lived.
- Prefer “thin slices” over big merges.
- Use feature flags for incomplete behaviour.

## Output format
- Slice plan (ordered)
- Flagging strategy (where needed)
- Merge sequencing + verification gates
