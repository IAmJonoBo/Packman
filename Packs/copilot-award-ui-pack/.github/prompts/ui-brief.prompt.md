Ask me ONLY for missing information, using this structure:

1. Platform + breakpoints:
2. Brand voice + adjectives (3–5):
3. Typeface(s) and constraints (if any):
4. Colour constraints (existing palette / avoid colours):
5. Density preference (compact/comfy) + target user skill:
6. Accessibility target (WCAG AA/AAA) + keyboard requirements:
7. Motion: none/subtle/expressive:
8. Product references (2–5):
9. Screen/flow scope:
10. Non-negotiables + “must avoid” list:

Then restate the brief as bullets for confirmation.
