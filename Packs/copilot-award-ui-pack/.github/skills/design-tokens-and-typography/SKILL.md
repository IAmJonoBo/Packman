# Design Tokens + Typography System

## Token taxonomy (minimum)
- Colour roles: bg/surface/on-surface/primary/on-primary/secondary/error/success/warning/outline
- Spacing: 4/8-based scale
- Radius: 2–4 steps
- Elevation/shadow: 3–5 steps (or none)
- Motion: durations/easing (if allowed)

## Typography
- Scale: 6–9 steps max
- Define for each step: size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing
- Rules: max line length, truncation, heading structure

## Enforcement
- Replace arbitrary values with tokens
- Add “rules of the road” doc
