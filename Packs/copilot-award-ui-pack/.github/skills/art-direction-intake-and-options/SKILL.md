# Art Direction Intake + Options

## Goal

Avoid guessing. Force clarity and provide options before implementation.

## Intake questions (ask only missing)

- Platform + breakpoints
- Brand voice (3–5 adjectives) + references
- Typeface constraints
- Colour constraints + theming needs
- Density preference + target user skill
- Accessibility target (WCAG AA/AAA)
- Motion preference
- “Must avoid” list + constraints (libs, deadlines, perf)

## Produce 2–3 directions (each must include)

1. Grid + spacing rhythm
2. Typography scale + hierarchy rules
3. Colour roles (semantic tokens) + state colours
4. Component language (radii, borders, elevation, icon style)
5. Composition rules (alignment, whitespace, content widths)
6. Risks + where it shines

## Decision

Recommend one direction and ask the user to confirm or request a merge.
