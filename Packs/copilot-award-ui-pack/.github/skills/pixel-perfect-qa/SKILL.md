# Pixel‑Perfect QA (Close-out)

## Visual

- Grid alignment: all elements snap to rhythm (8/4)
- Consistent radii/elevation/borders
- Clear hierarchy: primary action dominance; headings consistent
- Typography: no ad-hoc sizes/weights; line-length sensible
- Icons: consistent stroke/size; alignment with text baselines

## Interaction

- States: hover/active/focus/disabled + loading/empty/error/success
- Hit targets: buttons/controls comfortably tappable/clickable
- Motion: subtle, purposeful; respects reduced motion

## Accessibility

- Focus visible + focus appearance (keyboard)
- Semantics and labels
- Contrast assumptions and non-text contrast awareness

## Consistency

- No magic numbers: everything is tokens or justified exception
- Component variants documented
