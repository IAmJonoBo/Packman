# PROJECT_PLANNING

This guide defines a practical project-planning operating model:

1. Establish a baseline plan from a structured brief.
2. Run checkpoints on a fixed cadence.
3. Trigger variance triage on material change events.
4. Replan with explicit deltas and risk implications.
5. Require execution-gate review before major commitments.

The aim is a continuously reliable plan, not a static document.
