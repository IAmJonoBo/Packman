# Polish Checklist

## High-impact checks
- Naming: consistent, intention-revealing
- Errors: stable types, clear messages, safe detail level
- Defaults: safe and unsurprising
- Edge cases: input validation, null/empty, timeouts
- Logs: useful, non-secret, correlated (when applicable)
- Config: separated from code, environment-friendly
- Docs: examples match reality; quickstart works
- UI (if present): keyboard nav, focus, labels, states, empty/loading/error

## Output format
- Checklist results (pass/fail + fixes)
