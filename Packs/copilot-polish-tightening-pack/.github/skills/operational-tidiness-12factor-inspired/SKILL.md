# Operational Tidiness (12-factor inspired)

## Apply when relevant (services/ops)

- Configuration belongs in environment (not hardcoded)
- Logs are event streams (structured, correlated)
- Build/release/run are separate stages

## Output format

- Operational gaps
- Minimal fixes
- Verification steps
