type	name	path	description
agent	Contract Tester	.github/agents/contract-tester.agent.md	Adds contract tests for interface boundaries (schemas/types), ensuring breaking changes are caught early.
agent	Flake Hunter	.github/agents/flake-hunter.agent.md	Diagnoses and eliminates flaky tests; hardens locators, waits, and fixtures; improves reproducibility.
agent	Quality Engineer	.github/agents/quality-engineer.agent.md	Plans and implements deterministic tests and test seams, prioritising critical paths and reducing flakiness.
agent	Quality Gate Reviewer	.github/agents/quality-gate-reviewer.agent.md	Reviews changes for evidence of correctness: tests, determinism, coverage of critical paths, and maintainability.
agent	Test Implementer	.github/agents/test-implementer.agent.md	Implements tests and fixtures with repo conventions; avoids flakiness and keeps execution fast.
agent	Test Planner	.github/agents/test-planner.agent.md	Detects test stack, defines critical paths, and writes a minimal high-impact test plan.

prompt	brief:fixture-kit	.github/prompts/fixture-kit.prompt.md	>-
prompt	brief:make-tests-deterministic	.github/prompts/make-tests-deterministic.prompt.md	Remove flakiness by hardening locators, waits, fixtures, time, and randomness.
prompt	qa:quality-brief	.github/prompts/quality-brief.prompt.md	Ask for missing quality/testing constraints before proceeding.
prompt	qa:quality-review	.github/prompts/quality-review.prompt.md	>-
prompt	qa:quality-ship	.github/prompts/quality-ship.prompt.md	End-to-end quality pass: brief → plan → implement → de-flake → review.
skill	contract-testing-seams	.github/skills/contract-testing-seams/SKILL.md	Add contract tests for boundary interfaces and prevent accidental breaking changes.
skill	critical-path-inventory	.github/skills/critical-path-inventory/SKILL.md	Define and maintain a critical path inventory (top flows) and map them to tests to prevent regressions.
skill	deterministic-testing	.github/skills/deterministic-testing/SKILL.md	Make tests deterministic by controlling time, randomness, IO boundaries, and using stable locators and waits.
skill	flake-triage	.github/skills/flake-triage/SKILL.md	Systematically diagnose and eliminate flaky tests and reduce future flake risk.
