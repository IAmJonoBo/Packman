description: Ask for missing quality/testing constraints before proceeding.

Ask me ONLY for missing info:

1. Scope of change (feature/modules):
2. Risk level (low/med/high) and why:
3. Target platforms (web/desktop/mobile) + browsers/OS (if e2e):
4. Preferred test tools (if any) and CI constraints:
5. Non-negotiable critical flows to protect:
6. Any flaky areas or known pain points:
7. Time budget for tests (fast/medium/slow):

Then restate the brief and proceed with a critical path inventory + test plan.
