description: Ask only for missing constraints; restate as an executable brief.
agent: 'ask'

Ask me ONLY for missing information needed to proceed:

1) Goal and success criteria:
2) Scope boundaries (in/out):
3) Users and primary flows:
4) Constraints (stack, deps, platform, compliance):
5) Non-functional requirements (perf, reliability, security):
6) Timeline/risk tolerance:
7) Acceptance criteria + verification expectations:

Then:
- restate the brief (bullet points)
- list assumptions (if any)
- propose next steps as small, reversible slices
