description: Produce an observability gap report with concrete signal additions and alerting improvements.
---

Generate an observability gap report including:

- missing metrics/logs/traces/alerts,
- current vs target MTTD signals,
- false positive/negative risk,
- actionable instrumentation changes,
- validation queries and rollout checks.

Tie each proposed signal to at least one specific edge hypothesis.
