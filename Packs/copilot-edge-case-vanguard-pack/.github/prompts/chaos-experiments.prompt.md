description: Plan controlled chaos experiments to validate resilience assumptions with strict blast-radius controls.
---

Create a chaos experiment plan:

- steady-state hypothesis,
- fault injection method,
- blast radius and abort gates,
- success/failure metrics,
- rollback rehearsal and postmortem artifacts.

Prioritize experiments that expose hidden dependency and recovery coupling.
