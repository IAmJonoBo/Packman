# Heuristic UX Audit

## When to use
Use this when when you are asked asked to "improve UX" or audit a screen/flow.

## Checklist (evaluate and note evidence)
1) Information architecture: grouping, labels, navigation, findability
2) Visual hierarchy: heading structure, spacing rhythm, emphasis
3) Copy: clarity, tone, microcopy, error messaging
4) Interaction friction: clicks/steps, defaults, progressive disclosure
5) States: loading/empty/error/success; edge cases
6) Accessibility: keyboard flow, semantics, focus management

## Output format
- Issues list grouped by area
- Ranked fixes table (Impact / Effort / Rationale)
- Top 2–3 fixes implemented if editing is allowed
