# Prototype Verification Checklist

- [ ] Primary user goal is obvious within 5 seconds
- [ ] Primary action is visually dominant and labelled
- [ ] Loading state is non-janky and explains progress
- [ ] Empty state explains what’s missing and how to proceed
- [ ] Error state is actionable (recovery path) and non-blaming copy
- [ ] Success state confirms outcome + next step
- [ ] Keyboard: tab order is logical; focus is visible; no traps
- [ ] Semantics: headings/labels/landmarks are correct
- [ ] Contrast and hit targets are reasonable (assume WCAG-minded)
- [ ] No inconsistent spacing/typography vs design system
