- Prefer one standards objective per change slice.
- Require verification evidence for each slice before proceeding.
- Include rollback notes for any non-trivial or high-impact edit.
- Map changes to at least one control family (quality, security, supply-chain).
- Avoid broad rewrites unless explicitly approved.
